    <h1> About me </h1>

    <span>
      I am a Front-end developer based in Eppelheim, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Germany. In order to advance my skills in
      Web-Development I have built several Web-Apps and attended an extensive Coding School, where I learned
      professional operating principles in programming. Feel welcome to visit my public portfolio, which includes games,
      responsive websites and business apps.

        I started my career in nursing. First working in the intensive care unit, where I gained a strong foundation of
        medical knowledge, and then at a Stroke Unit because I wanted to have more direct contact with my patients.
        Working in healthcare has taught me patience, resilience and adaptability to alleviate the most pressing needs
        of the people I work with and for.

        In my free time, I like to read fiction and have cookouts with my family and friends. I am open for new
        challenges and hope I will be given a chance to apply my coding experience as a junior developer.
